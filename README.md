# VM Server Allocation

This is basic CLI for allocating VMs to physical servers. It uses “best fit”
approximation algorithm to compute the required amount of physical servers and
the allocation of virtual machines to physical servers.

## Requirements

- Python3.9+
- Python Poetry

## Installation

```bash
> poetry install
```

## Run

```bash
> poetry run python vm_servers.py <required_cores> <required_memory_mb> <required_network_bandwidth_kbps>
```

## Limitations

- PhysicalServers are hardcoded
- Allocations are not persisted between runs
